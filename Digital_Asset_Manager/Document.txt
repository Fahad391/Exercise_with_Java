Sample Project - 2: Digital Asset Management System
Goal: To track different types of digital assets

1) Built Blue print with Abstraction and Interface to define common behavior and enforce abstraction
2) Built Specific Assets using Inheritance
3) Used Encapsulation to hide specific data
4) Used Method Overriding to provide the specific implementation
for abstract method inherited from parent class
      and
used overloading to create two versions of constructor

5) Used polymorphism to put all things together.
